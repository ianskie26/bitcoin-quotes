## Details

I could not find a bitcoin quotes API that works for me so I used a Python Twitter scraper ([SNScrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape)) to consolidate a list of Bitcoin quotes/sayings. Using the State hook, it is getting the quotes from a data file. It pulls a new quote on page load and when the Bitcoin logo is clicked.
